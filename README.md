## About The Project
Milk Grade-Guard provides a multifaceted strategy to improve food safety. The solution can eliminate human error, save costs related to manual testing, and streamline operations by automating quality assessments using machine learning. 
More significantly, less product waste is produced and dangerous milk is kept
from reaching customers thanks to early problem detection enabled by ML- powered prediction. In order to confirm Milk Grade-Guard's function in strengthening food safety protocols within the dairy industry, more investigation and development are necessary
