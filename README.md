## About The Project
Milk Grade-Guard provides a multifaceted strategy to improve food safety. The solution can eliminate human error, save costs related to manual testing, and streamline operations by automating quality assessments using machine learning. 
More significantly, less product waste is produced and dangerous milk is kept
from reaching customers thanks to early problem detection enabled by ML- powered prediction. In order to confirm Milk Grade-Guard's function in strengthening food safety protocols within the dairy industry, more investigation and development are necessary

## Basic Concepts

- ### Milk grading parameters: 
  Our machine learning approach for assessing milk quality, Milk Grade-Guard, depends on a number of factors to reliably       predict milk grade. Below is a summary of the primary parameters that will be employed:

  ***Fat Content:*** One of the most important markers of milk quality is its fat content. Deviations from the anticipated 
  range could indicate problems with the health of the cows or water dilution.<br/>***pH Level:*** The pH level of fresh 
  milk is slightly acidic. Significant departures from this range may be a sign of faulty storage or spoiling brought on by 
  bacterial development.<br/>***Temperature:*** During storage and transit, milk should be kept within a certain range. 
  Deviations may damage quality by hastening the growth of microorganisms.<br/>***Color:*** Depending on the breed and 
  nutrition, natural milk color can change slightly. Severe discolouration may indicate contamination or spoiling. 
  <br/>***Taste:*** While taste tests may not be feasible for a large-scale system, the machine learning model may benefit 
  from past data on flavor assessments made by human specialists. Odd tastes may be a sign of infection or spoiling. 
  <br/>***Odor:*** Like taste, odor data (provided by human specialists) can be used to train models. Odd smells can 
  indicate the presence of microorganisms or spoiling.<br/>***Turbidity:*** Clarity-impairing contaminants might alter the 
  quality of milk. Turbidity readings are used by Milk Grade-Guard into its machine learning model to help it forecast milk 
  grade more accurately.

- ### Machine Learning
  Machine learning is  a quickly emerging field of technology which enables computers to automatically learn from the          historical data. Machine learning uses various algorithms to create mathematical models and forecasts based on information 
  or historical data. Nowadays it is being used for many different things, like image recognition, recommender systems, 
  email filtering, and speech recognition.
  Machine learning can be broadly classified into three types. These classification is based on the nature of the learning 
  system and the data available. The types are as follows:
    - Supervised learning:Labeled data is used to teach models how to predict outcomes.
    - Unsupervised Learning: In this process, algorithms sift through unlabeled data in search of patterns or clusters.
    - Reinforcement Learning: In this approach, models gain decision-making skills by acting in a way that maximizes a 
      concept of cumulative reward.

- ### Classification Model
  The supervised ML are classified into 2 types namely Regression model and Classification model . The classification 
  algorithms in machine learning are essential for categorizing data into predefined classes. Before using the model to make 
  predictions on newly discovered data, it must first be thoroughly trained on training data and assessed on test data. Some 
  popular classification algorithms include Logistic regression , Naive bayes classification , KNN , Decision trees, SVM .

- ### KNN
  The KNN algorithm is commonly employed as a classification algorithm, based on the premise that comparable points can be 
  located next to one another, while it can be used for regression or classification problems as well.<br/><br/>

  The distance between a query point and the other data points must be computed in order to ascertain which data points are 
  closest to a particular query point. The decision boundaries that divide query points into various areas are formed in 
  part by the below distance measurement formula.

  Distance Euclidean (p=2): This distance metric is restricted to real-valued vectors and is the most widely used one. It 
  measures a straight line between the query location and the other point being measured using the formula below.<br/>
